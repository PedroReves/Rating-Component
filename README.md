## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this Project i learned more about states and how can i handle them, like how can i interact between pages and so on, it was a good project to mess with javascript a little bit.

### Continued development

I would like to fix some issues in this project later on, i'd like to see more about color transparency and what's the best way to handle them, i kept with the design, but there was some parts that i couldn't do exactly because of the color transparency.
